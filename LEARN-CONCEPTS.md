## 1. NestJS Framework

### What is NestJS?

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript by default and combines elements of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming (FP), and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).

### Key Components in NestJS

1. **Modules**: Organize application components and provide boundaries.
2. **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and return responses to the client.
3. **Providers/Services**: Implement business logic and can be injected into controllers or other services.
4. **Pipes**: Transform or validate data before it reaches the route handler.
5. **Guards**: Determine whether a request should be handled by the route handler.
6. **Interceptors**: Add extra logic before/after method execution, transform results, etc.
7. **Middleware**: Functions that have access to the request and response objects.

### How NestJS is Used in This Project

In this project, NestJS provides the foundation for:
- Creating RESTful API endpoints
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Organizing code into modules (Auth, User, Organization, etc.)
- Dependency injection for services
- Request validation using pipes
- Route protection using guards

## 2. TypeScript

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It adds static types to JavaScript, which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime.

### Key TypeScript Concepts

1. **Static Typing**: Defining types for variables, function parameters, and return values.
2. **Interfaces**: Defining contracts for objects.
3. **Classes**: Object-oriented programming with inheritance, encapsulation, etc.
4. **Generics**: Creating reusable components that work with different types.
5. **Type Inference**: TypeScript can infer types when not explicitly defined.
6. **Union and Intersection Types**: Combining types in different ways.
7. **Decorators**: Adding metadata to classes and class members.

### How TypeScript is Used in This Project

In this project, TypeScript provides:
- Type safety for all variables, parameters, and return values
- Interfaces for DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- Classes for services, controllers, and entities
- Decorators for NestJS components
- Type checking for database models via Prisma

## 3. Prisma ORM

### What is Prisma?

Prisma is a next-generation Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that makes working with databases easy for application developers. It consists of three main components: Prisma Client, Prisma Migrate, and Prisma Studio.

### Key Prisma Concepts

1. **Prisma Schema**: Defines your database models and relationships.
2. **Prisma Client**: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder.
3. **Prisma Migrate**: Database migration system.
4. **Prisma Studio**: GUI to view and edit data in your database.
5. **Relations**: Defining relationships between models (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
6. **Seeding**: Populating your database with initial data.

### How Prisma is Used in This Project

In this project, Prisma:
- Defines database models (User, Role, Permission, etc.)
- Manages relationships between models
- Provides type-safe database queries
- Handles database migrations
- Seeds the database with initial data (admin user, permissions)

## 4. Authentication & Authorization

### What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question: "Who are you?"

### What is Authorization?

Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has permission to access a resource or perform an action. It answers the question: "What are you allowed to do?"

### Key Authentication & Authorization Concepts

1. **Authentication Strategies**: Different ways to authenticate users (password, OAuth, etc.).
2. **Credentials**: Information used to verify identity (username/password, tokens, etc.).
3. **Sessions vs. Tokens**: Different ways to maintain authentication state.
4. **Authorization Models**: RBAC, ABAC, etc.
5. **Permission Checking**: Verifying if a user can perform an action.

### How Authentication & Authorization are Used in This Project

In this project:
- Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Users register and login with username/password
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Access tokens and refresh tokens are used
- Authorization is implemented using a multi-level permission system:
  - Role-based permissions
  - Department-level permissions
  - User-specific permissions

## 5. JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

### What are JWTs?

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. They are often used for authentication and information exchange.

### Key JWT Concepts

1. **Token Structure**: Header, Payload, Signature
2. **Claims**: Statements about an entity (typically the user) and metadata
3. **Signing**: Creating a signature to verify the token's authenticity
4. **Verification**: Ensuring the token hasn't been tampered with
5. **Expiration**: Setting a time limit for token validity
6. **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived tokens used to obtain new access tokens

### How JWTs are Used in This Project

In this project, JWTs:
- Authenticate users after login
- Store user information (ID, role, permissions) in the token payload
- Provide short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Provide long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
- Are stored in the User model for invalidation when needed

## 6. Multi-Tenancy

### What is Multi-Tenancy?

Multi-tenancy is a software architecture where a single instance of an application serves multiple customers (tenants). Each tenant's data is isolated from other tenants.

### Key Multi-Tenancy Concepts

1. **Tenant**: A customer or organization using the application
2. **Data Isolation**: Keeping each tenant's data separate
3. **Tenant Identification**: Determining which tenant a request belongs to
4. **Multi-Tenant Models**: Different approaches (separate databases, shared database with separate schemas, shared database with tenant ID)

### How Multi-Tenancy is Used in This Project

In this project:
- Organizations represent tenants
- Each organization has its own departments, roles, and employees
- Data is isolated at the application level using organization IDs
- Resources are associated with specific organizations

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of restricting system access to authorized users based on their roles within an organization.

### Key RBAC Concepts

1. **Roles**: Collections of permissions assigned to users
2. **Permissions**: Rights to perform specific operations
3. **Users**: Individuals who are assigned roles
4. **Operations**: Actions that can be performed on resources
5. **Objects/Resources**: Entities that users can access

### How RBAC is Used in This Project

In this project, RBAC is extended to a multi-level permission system:
- Roles have permissions (e.g., "Admin" role has "user:create" permission)
- Departments have permissions (e.g., "Engineering" department has "project:read" permission)
- Users have specific permissions (e.g., User "John" has "resource:delete" permission)
- Permissions follow a resource:action format (e.g., "user:create", "department:read")
- Guards check permissions before allowing access to endpoints

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are objects that carry data between processes or layers in an application. They help define the shape of data for specific operations.

### Key DTO Concepts

1. **Input Validation**: Ensuring data meets requirements before processing
2. **Type Safety**: Providing type information for data structures
3. **Documentation**: Self-documenting API contracts
4. **Transformation**: Converting between different data representations

### How DTOs are Used in This Project

In this project:
- DTOs define the structure of request bodies (e.g., CreateUserDto)
- Class-validator decorators provide validation rules
- DTOs are used in controllers to validate incoming data
- Different DTOs are used for different operations (create, update, etc.)

## 12. Guards & Interceptors

### What are Guards?

Guards are classes that determine whether a request should be handled by the route handler or not, typically for authentication and authorization.

### What are Interceptors?

Interceptors are classes that can intercept the execution of a method (controller or service) and add extra logic before or after method execution.

### Key Guard & Interceptor Concepts

1. **Route Protection**: Preventing unauthorized access to routes
2. **Request/Response Transformation**: Modifying requests or responses
3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Handling aspects that affect multiple parts of the application
4. **Execution Context**: Information about the current execution environment

### How Guards & Interceptors are Used in This Project
